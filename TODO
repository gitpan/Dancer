            This is the roadmap of upcoming developments

* Route caching support

    When a path is firstly resolved through the route tree, we should
    cache the result for future calls.

    The path would be the cache key, the first route the value.

        1 - GET / -> first call, so browse the route tree
        2 - GET / -> second call, return cache('/');
