                                    Dancer

                  The easiest way to write a webapp with Perl                                    


=== ABOUT ===

That project intends to become a port of Ruby's Sinatra framework: a framework
for building web application with minimal-effort in mind.

The user should be able to define a webapp with very few lines of codes.


=== EXAMPLE ===

Here is an example of a webapp built with Dancer:

    # webapp.pl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use Dancer;

    get '/' => sub {
        "Hello There!"
    };

    get '/hello/:name' => sub {
        "Hey ".params->{name}.", how are you?";
    };

    post '/new' => sub {
        "creating new entry: ".params->{name};
    };

    Dancer->dance;

When running this script, a webserver is running and ready to serve:    

    $ perl ./webapp.pl
    >> Listening on 127.0.0.1:1915
    == Entering the dance floor ...

Then it's possible to access any route defined in the script:

    $ curl http://localhost:1915/
    Hello There!


Feel free to fork that project if you like the idea and want to add some
features.


=== DEPENDENCIES ===

Dancer depends on the following modules

    - HTTP::Server::Simple
    - File::MimeInfo
    - File::Spec
    - File::Basename

Dancer may also depend on other modules if optional features are used:

    - Tempalte          needed for views rendering
